<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Learning isnt easy especailly when you embark on your own, you need dicipline, action, and comitment to 
  get it done, most of which until recently I had not. Personally why lie and say that I have always been this 
  driven hard working guy? Most of the time I am simply not as diciplined as one should be, however that doesn't
  mean that I'll stay like this always.<p>
<p>Most recently my time has been slowly and steadly devoted into 3 pillars on which someday I'll stand tall and proud.
  One day I will look back and firmlly be joyful and prideful of where I started.</p>
